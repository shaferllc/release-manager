# Release Manager

Desktop app to manage releases for all your app projects. Add project folders (npm, Rust, Go, or Python), see version and git status, then bump and push or tag-and-push. Includes a **Documentation** tab in the app with all features and how to use them.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm (for npm projects)
- Git (for tag & push)

## Quick start

```bash
cd release-manager
npm install
npm start
```

1. Click **Add project** and choose a folder that contains a supported manifest: `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, or `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`.
2. Select a project to see its version, git state, and release options.
3. For **npm**: use **Patch**, **Minor**, or **Major** to bump, then tag and push. For **Rust / Go / Python**: update the version in your manifest if needed, then use **Tag and push**.

**In-app docs:** Open the **Documentation** tab in the sidebar for the full feature list and usage.

## Downloads

**Latest:** v0.4.2 — [Release & downloads](https://github.com/shaferllc/release-manager/releases/latest)

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Multiple package managers** | npm (package.json), Rust (Cargo.toml), Go (go.mod), Python (pyproject.toml / setup.py). Version and name are read from the right manifest. |
| **Project detail** | Version, latest tag, released versions list (with links and download per version for GitHub). Collapsible Git, Version & release, Sync & download sections. |
| **Release (npm)** | Patch / Minor / Major / Pre-release bump, then commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, and push. Optional release notes, draft, and pre-release (with GitHub token). |
| **Tag and push (Rust/Go/Python)** | Tag current version from the manifest and push (no bump from the app). |
| **Git** | Branch, ahead/behind, uncommitted files. Commit from the app with a message. |
| **Sync & download** | `git fetch` (Sync). Download latest or choose a version to download GitHub Release assets. |
| **Open in Terminal / Editor** | Open project folder in the system terminal or in Cursor / VS Code. |
| **Open in Finder / Copy path** | Reveal in file manager or copy path to clipboard. |
| **Dashboard** | Table of all projects (name, version, tag, branch, ahead/behind). Filter and sort. |
| **Batch release** | Select multiple projects and run Patch / Minor / Major for all (npm only). |
| **Settings** | Optional GitHub token for higher limits, private repos, and creating/updating releases. Optional **Ollama** base URL and model for generating commit messages and release notes. |
| **Generate with Ollama** | Use a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model to generate commit messages and release notes. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`. Set base URL and model in Settings, then use **Generate** (commit) or **Generate with Ollama** (release notes) in the project view. |
| **Theme** | Dark / Light toggle; choice is saved. |

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Run the app |
| `npm run dev` | Run with Electron logging |
| `npm run watch` | Restart on main/renderer changes (nodemon) |
| `npm run build:css` | Build Tailwind CSS |
| `npm run build` | Package with electron-builder |
| `npm test` | Run test suite (Jest) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage |
| `npm run test:e2e` | E2E smoke test (launches app, checks UI) |

**Development:** `npm start` runs the app without the file watcher. Use `npm run dev` to run with Electron logging and auto-reload on file changes. To disable reload in dev (e.g. if you see SIGABRT on restart), set `DISABLE_ELECTRON_RELOAD=1`.

## Troubleshooting

- **App exits with SIGABRT** – Reload is only enabled when you run `npm run dev`. If you use `npm start`, the watcher is off and the app should not crash from it. If you still see SIGABRT (e.g. when using `npm run dev`), run with reload disabled: `DISABLE_ELECTRON_RELOAD=1 npm run dev`, or use `npm start` and restart the app manually after code changes.

## Tests

Logic in `src-main/lib/` is unit-tested (Jest). Run `npm run test:coverage` for coverage. `npm run test:e2e` runs a Playwright smoke test that launches the app and checks the main UI (requires `npm run build:css` first).

## Releasing this app

Push a tag `v*` (e.g. `v0.2.0`); GitHub Actions builds and creates a Release. Or add this repo as a project in the app and use Release there.

Workflows live in `.github/workflows/` and must be on the **default branch** (e.g. `main`) to appear. Open **Actions** at: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions`. If no workflows show, check **Settings → Actions → General** and ensure "Allow all actions" (or the desired level) is enabled.
